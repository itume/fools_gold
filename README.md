## Usage

Install fools_gold, You can use Yen class.
Yen is the currency of Japan.

```
ichi_man_yen = Yen.new(10_000)
```

Yen has methods for calculate consumption tax.
````
ichi_man_yen.with_tax
ichi_man_yen.without_tax
````

Yen instance keeps the state with or without tax.
Default value is "without tax" (Beacause I don't like any tax.)
You can change tax state with "!" methods
```
ichi_man_yen.with_tax?
#=> true

# "!"method changes tax state
ichi_man_yen.without_tax!
ichi_man_yen.with_tax?
#=> false
ichi_man_yen.without_tax?
#=> true

# if state is without_tax and call without_tax!, raise TaxEvationError
ichi_man_yen.without_tax!
#=>TaxEvationError

# if state is with_tax and call with_tax!, raise DoubleTaxaionError
ichi_man_yen.with_tax!
ichi_man_yen.with_tax?
#=> true
ichi_man_yen.with_tax!
#=>DoubleTaxaionError
```

Yen instance has consumption tax rate. This rate uses tax calculation.
Default tax rate is now 8%.
```
ichi_man_yen.tax_rate
#=> 0.08
```

In Oct.1 2019, Japanese government will introduce reduced consumption tax rate.
fools_gold can calculate reduced tax.
```
ichi_man_yen.with_reduced_tax
ichi_man_yen.without_reduced_tax
```
So, from Oct.1 2019, default tax rate changes to 10%.
Reduced tax means set tax rate to 8%.
```
ichi_man_yen.tax_rate
#=> 0.1
ichi_man_yen.reduced_tax_rate
#=> 0.08
```
